#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void fun(){
  
    static int x = 1;
    int y = 1;
    
    x++;
    y++;
    
    cout << x << " " << y << endl;
}

int main() {
	fun();
	fun();
	fun();
	return 0;
}

so when 1st time fun is called 
static int x=1; 
this line get executed
output - 2 2
IN 2nd call this line is not executed
output 4 2
IN 3nd call again this line is not executed
output 6 2

coz "static" is executed only once.
